# 0001: Framework Choice

## Context
The project needed a modern React and TypeScript stack with quick builds and minimal configuration.

## Decision
Adopt **Vite** for bundling and dev server with React and TypeScript.

## Consequences
- Fast hot-module reloading and optimized production builds.
- Suits static hosting without server-side rendering.
- Simpler configuration compared to heavier frameworks like Next.js.
