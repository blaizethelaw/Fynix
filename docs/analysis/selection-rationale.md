# Selection Rationale

- **Framework:** Vite with React and TypeScript provides fast dev server and fits static hosting needs.
- **Charting:** Recharts was selected for declarative components and wide adoption.
- **Design System:** Custom Tailwind-based primitives (Button, Card, Input, Modal, Tabs, Tooltip, Toast, ChartContainer) abstract UI patterns from scattered prototypes.
- **Content:** Retained planning and recovery guides; other HTML variants were considered redundant.
