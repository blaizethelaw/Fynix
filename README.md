## Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev --workspace app
```

## Scripts
- `npm run build` – build the app
- `npm test` – run unit tests
- `node scripts/verify-branding.mjs` – checks logo, byline, and tagline (requires preview server)

## Branding Rules
- BrandMark uses https://i.imgur.com/VXfQFab.png with visible byline “by BLAiZE IT🔥”.
- Tagline “From ashes to assets” appears on the home page and must remain visible at all breakpoints.
